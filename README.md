## Features

- Offline functionality
- No need to authenticate to view details
- Tracking and coach position shortcuts
- Make life easier :)

# Instruction
- Open url in safari
- Open share
- Click Add to homescreen

## Motivation

- When I book train ticket, I will send the ticket to whatsapp to quickly view. Because in irctc we need to login and click atleast 3, 4 times to view the ticket.
- Even if I have the ticket in whatsapp, It's hard to locate seat number and coach. I feel like there is too much distracting data.
- With the rising AI tools, I wanted to check how quickly can I build this. I used Trae and Claude to build this. It's not jaw dropping experience but it's helpful, or I would have never done this.

## Todo
- Add info about how the screenshot should be
- Improve error boundary UI
- If I add the same ticket again update the old one (don't duplicate)
- May add info about how many journeys I have done so far
